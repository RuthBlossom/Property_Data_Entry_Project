# Rental Property Scraper and Form Filler

## Overview
This Python script scrapes rental property data from a webpage and fills in a Google Form with the extracted information. It utilizes BeautifulSoup for web scraping and Selenium for automating form filling.

## Prerequisites
- Python 
- BeautifulSoup (`pip install beautifulsoup4`)
- Requests (`pip install requests`)
- Selenium (`pip install selenium`)
- ChromeDriver (for Selenium)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the script files.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download ChromeDriver from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) and place it in your system PATH or specify its location in the script.

## Usage
1. Run the Python script `rental_property_scraper.py`.
2. The script will scrape rental property data from the specified webpage and fill in a Google Form with the extracted information.
3. Ensure that the Google Form link is provided in the script (`driver.get("YOUR_FORM_LINK")`).
4. The form fields filled are for address, price, and link. Adjust XPath values in the script according to your form structure.

## Notes
- The script uses Selenium with ChromeDriver to interact with the Google Form. Ensure you have ChromeDriver installed and configured correctly.
- Customize the script according to your specific webpage layout and form structure if necessary.
- This script is for educational and personal use only. Be responsible and respectful when scraping data from websites.
